-- Solution: CASE WHEN
-- For this question, the last operation of a stock is always "sell" 
-- and it is guaranteed that every "sell" has a "buy" before it,
-- so we could simplify this to a CASE WHEN questions, otherwise, WINDOW FUNCTION could be a better choice

            WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
